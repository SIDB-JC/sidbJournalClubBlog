title: Depolarization, but Not Hyperpolarization, of MECII Causes “Artificial Remapping” in CA1
---
In our third journal club, Klara presented results from ["A Novel Mechanism for the Grid-to-Place Cell Transformation Revealed by Transgenic Depolarization of Medial Entorhinal Cortex Layer II"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.001) 

I include Klara's summary on this journal club:

I talked about a paper where they stimulated neurons in the superficial MEC using excitatory DREADDs. This caused superficial MEC grid cells to undergo rate remapping, but not global remapping. They also recorded hippocampal place cells during the same stimulation protocol and found that place cells remapped. I also talked about the next experiments this lab performed that I've seen at SFN on their poster. They found that after the initial CNO injection, most place fields moved back to their location from before the stimulation. When they repeated the experiment, the place fields moved to the same 'remapped' place as in the first test. They also found that place cells had a few spikes in the future remapped locations, so they could predict where a given place cell would likely move its field when it remaps. I thought this was very interesting, because it suggests that the system has a few stable states that is can transition between when it's stimulated.
