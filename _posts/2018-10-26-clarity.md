title: Cocaine, foot shock, and CLARITY
---
In our second journal club, Cristina presented a paper from Deisseroth's lab ["Wiring and Molecular Features of Prefrontal Ensembles Representing Distinct Experiences"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741630558X?via%3Dihub) 
(Cristina has actually very recently visited their lab and had the chance to image her own cleared mouse brains using their custom-built light sheet microscope.)

The paper seemed to introduce many new "discoveries", and while they are definitely new, perhaps some of them are a bit oversold 
(on the other hand, this seems to be the case in many recent publications, so not really surprising. And I am sure a lot of work went into this). 
One such example was the "Flow-assisted clearing setup", which, in my opinion, seemed like an overkill (Cristina and Kirsty use the humble shaking incubator and
can achieve good quality clearing without the need for fancy set-ups).

One of the findings that I personally found interesting in this paper (note I do NOT have a neuroscience/proper biology background) was the fact that foot shock, and cocaine 
activate overlapping brain regions (see figure 2).

There was a good discussion on Figure 7, particularly parts C-E. It was not entirely clear from the paper what was the expectation of the results.
From the supplementary materials (see **Real-time conditioned place preference** paragraph) it seems that the animals received foot shocks
or cocaine independently of their location in the "experimental box". However, it was clear that the optogenitics stimulation did induce
a significant change in location preference (personally, I still do not understand why would the animals have a preference if they received the
cocaine/shock at presumably random locations).
