title: Mapping activity in cleared brains
---
I presented ["Mapping of Brain Activity by Automated Volume Analysis of Immediate Early Genes"](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)30555-4)
by Renier et al. from 2016.

The paper discusses their improved solvent based clearing methods (IDISCO+) and how this fits into their automated activity analysis.
In essence, the paper combines available open-source tools such as [Elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/) (for registering the 3D data onto Allen Brin Atlas,
and Python libraries like [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) (which enable Watershed segmentation for example). 
By combining he above, the authors developed an analysis tool they called [Clearmap](https://idisco.info/clearmap-2/). 
Clearmap can output "heatmaps" of cell activity, which can allow easy visulisation of brain-wide activity. But the really useful
aspect of Clearmap is the so called "voxel-based" statistics, which enables straightforward statistical comparison between corresponding 
brain regions between control and experimental groups.
As a side note: Clearmap is nice, because it was written in a way to be easily custimised (for instance, it already has an option to use machine learning based cell counting using
[ilastix](http://ilastik.org/).
