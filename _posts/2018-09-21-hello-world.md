title: What is this journal club for?
---
The purpose of these meetings is to firstly encourage discussion on the topics in the field of neuroscience and beyond (as long as you can explain it to general audience!). 

The initial idea of the format would be to keep the presentation to 20-30 minutes to leave plenty of time for discussion.

I hope to keep this "blog" updated as long as possible, so we can keep track of what was presented, and who we can pester about more information.

**[Update 28/09/2018]**
During the first journal club we agreed that the format should not be restricted to article presentations. Essentially, anything goes as long as it is to do with *Science!*. For instance, you can introduce a specific technique that you are an expert in.
